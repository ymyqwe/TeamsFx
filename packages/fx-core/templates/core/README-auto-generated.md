# TeamsFx Project

## Take a tour of your app source code

After initializing the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code after the Teams Toolkit registers and configures your app. The following table lists all the scaffolded folder and files by Teams Toolkit:

| File name | Contents |
|- | -|
|`.fx/configs/config.local.json`| Configuration file for local environment |
|`.fx/configs/config.dev.json`| Configuration file for dev environment |
|`.fx/configs/projectSettings.json`| Global project settings, which apply to all environments |
|`templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json`|Teams app manifest template|
|`templates/appPackage/resources`|Teams app's icon referenced by manifest template|
